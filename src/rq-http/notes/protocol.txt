The RQ-HTTP protocol is multi-layered.  This means that some commands contain a series of other commands.
Even though we have multiple layers, we will use the same number set throughout.  We will just have different processors.

When a connection is established, the browser client will immediately send a GET/POST/HEAD/* request followed by a number 
of headers, and then depending on some of the headers, can then be followed by data.

Some requests may even be mime-encoded, which means that we will need to process that also.

A typical request being send to a consumer would be.

CLEAR
HOST <host>
REMOTE_HOST <ip>
PATH <url>
METHOD_GET (or METHOD_POST or METHOD_HEAD)
ENCODING <gzip>
LANGUAGE <en-us>
HEADERS
	HEADER <header>
	EXECUTE
	HEADER <header>
	EXECUTE
PARAMS
	KEY <key>
	VALUE <value>
	EXECUTE
	KEY <key>
	VALUE <value>
	EXECUTE
FILE
	LENGTH <filelength>
	FILENAME <name>
	EXECUTE

EXECUTE




This is quite a lot of data, and it would need to be processed as quickly as possible.
