This document describes the protocol that will be used by nodes and controllers to communicate.

RQ uses a RISP based protocol


Consuming a Queue.

		RQ_CMD_CLEAR
		RQ_CMD_CONSUME
		RQ_CMD_QUEUE <tiny string>
		RQ_CMD_MAX <tiny int>       [optional]
		RQ_CMD_PRIORITY <tiny int>  [optional]
		RQ_CMD_EXECUTE

		This operation will result in:

		RQ_CMD_CLEAR
		RQ_CMD_QUEUE <tiny string>
		RQ_CMD_QUEUEID <short int>
		RQ_CMD_EXECUTE

		Which will indicate that the Queue ID can and should be used instead of the full queue string.

Cancelling a Queue

		RQ_CMD_CLEAR
		RQ_CMD_CANCEL_QUEUE
		RQ_CMD_QUEUE <short string> [optional]
		RQ_CMD_QUEUEID <short int>  [optional]
		RQ_CMD_EXECUTE

		This operation requires at least a RQ_CMD_QUEUE or a RQ_CMD_QUEUEID.

Sending a Request

Request Undelivered.

	If a request couldn't be delivered (either for timeout failure, or the controller has closed)
				
		RQ_CMD_CLEAR
		RQ
